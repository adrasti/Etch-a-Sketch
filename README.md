# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple Etch-a-Sketch web page - a grid containing a certain number of equal squares.

The number of squares per row (and column) can be specified by 
pushing the "New grid" button (default = 4, max = 100).

Hovering over the squares for the first time causes the selection of a random background
color for them; Hovering over them again makes them darker and darker until they turn black.
